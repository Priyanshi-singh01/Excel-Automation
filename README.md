Excel Data Entry Automation using VBA Macro Recorder.

This project demonstrates how to automate a data entry process in Microsoft Excel using the built-in **VBA Macro Recorder**.
The goal of this project is to reduce manual work and show how repetitive Excel tasks can be automated without initially writing VBA code manually.

## 📌 Project Overview

This Excel file contains a simple **Data Entry Form** where:
- User enters Date, Name, Product, and Quantity
- Product rate is automatically fetched from a master rate list
- Amount is calculated automatically
- Data is stored in a structured table with one click
  
A **video** is included in this repository that shows the complete process of creating and using the macro.
